# How to add a new source to the Mondo Ingest

1. Add a new import and component to [src/ontology/mondo-ingest-odk.yaml](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo-ingest/blob/main/src/ontology/mondo-ingest-odk.yaml).
2. Add a new metadata file to [src/ontology/metadata](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo-ingest/blob/main/src/ontology/metadata). It is important we try and document as much about the source as we can.
3. Update the Website Table of Contents [mkdocs.yaml](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo-ingest/blob/main/mkdocs.yaml)
