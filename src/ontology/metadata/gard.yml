  The GARD mapping is mainly curated through the GARD-ORDO and GARD-OMIM mappings.
  From the GARD developers, we have confirmed that, For a given GARD ID, 
  GARD guarantees no other concept will be assigned in the future.  
  The concept will not be assigned to a different GARD ID, but this GARD ID may be retired 
  when a similar but more accurate concept is created under a new GARD ID to replace this GARD ID.
